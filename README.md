## Earthquake Report
In this lab I am using live data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey), specifically a data set showing significant earthquakes (M4.0 or greater) from the past month.

**My goal was to**: 
- Obtain data from an API
- Display a Google Map with a pin at the epicenter of each quake.
- List information about each quake.
